If the output is a number or several numbers like how serious a disease is, 
how emotional some music is, or how cute a kitten is we call it regression.

Machine Learning can create new images, music or synthetic speech in which 
case we call it a generative model.

Whenever we train a model on examples of input and output, we call it supervised learning.
Wâ€‹hat is the output of classification? : category, these categories are also called classes.

feature extraction  (zero crossing count)
Learning = Representation + Evaluation + Optimization. ...
Feature Engineering is the Key
Feature extraction is important in machine learning. By having many datasets we can make good decision.
